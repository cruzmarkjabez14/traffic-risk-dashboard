“Predicting High-Risk Traffic Periods in Metro Manila Using MMDA Incident Data”
SDG: 11 Sustainable Cities and Communities
Dataset: Manila Traffic Incident Data
The dataset titled “Manila Traffic Incident Data”, created by esparko on Kaggle, provides
detailed reports of traffic incidents across Metro Manila. The information was gathered from the
official MMDA (Metro Manila Development Authority) Twitter account and compiled into a
structured format. Each entry represents a unique traffic-related event, such as accidents,
stalled vehicles, or road obstructions, along with details like the location, type of incident, time,
and number of lanes affected. The dataset contains 17,312 records and 13 attributes, covering
several cities including Quezon City, Makati, Mandaluyong, Pasig, and San Juan. It is
particularly useful for analyzing traffic patterns, identifying congestion hotspots, and
understanding the common causes of road disruptions in Metro Manila.

Problem Statement:
Metro Manila faces persistent traffic congestion and frequent road incidents that cause
delays, safety hazards, and economic losses. Many of these incidents occur during specific
hours of the day, yet there is limited research utilizing available data to identify or predict these
high-risk time periods. The MMDA traffic incident dataset contains valuable temporal information
such as the date, time, city, and type of incident that can be analyzed to uncover accident trends
and patterns. However, without a predictive framework, authorities and commuters remain
reactive rather than proactive in addressing traffic risks.
This lack of time-based predictive insights hinders effective traffic management and urban
mobility planning. By applying machine learning techniques to analyze temporal patterns in
MMDA data, it becomes possible to predict high-risk traffic periods, allowing policymakers and
drivers to anticipate congestion, improve road safety, and plan more efficient travel. This
research supports Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11: Sustainable Cities and
Communities, which emphasizes creating safe, inclusive, and sustainable urban transport
systems.
Computer Application Overview:
The proposed system is a data-driven web application prototype designed to help users
visualize and predict high-risk traffic periods across Metro Manila using historical MMDA traffic
incident data. It applies machine learning predictions and interactive data visualization to identify
when and where road incidents are most likely to occur.
Purpose of the System
The main purpose of this prototype is to provide a visual and predictive tool that can guide both
commuters and traffic authorities in making better travel and management decisions. By
showing patterns of traffic incidents over time, users can anticipate congestion-prone hours and
locations, improving safety and mobility.
